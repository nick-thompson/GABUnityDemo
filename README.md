# GABUnityDemo

This project is a quick JUCE Audio Plugin example implementing a first order lowpass filter with export targets for a standalone audio application, an audio unit, and a Unity
native audio plugin. This example was used in a talk I gave at a local Game Audio Boston meetup. [Read more](https://nickwritesablog.com/under-the-hood-native-audio-plugins-for-unity/).

## Building
This plugin example is set up to be very easy to work with (on Mac OS X). After cloning or downloading the project, you should
be able to open the file at `Builds/MacOSX/GABUnityDemo.xcodeproj` in Xcode and compile the project immediately.

After that, you'll find all the compiled binary files in `Builds/MacOSX/build/Debug` or `Builds/MacOSX/build/Release`, depending
on your build configuration.
